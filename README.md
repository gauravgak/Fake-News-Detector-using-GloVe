# Fake-News-Detector-using-GloVe
Project Description: Fake News Detector using GloVe Embeddings
Project Overview:
The Fake News Detector is an intelligent machine learning model that uses GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings to distinguish between genuine and fake news articles. The goal of this project is to help users identify potentially misleading or false information circulating on social media and news platforms.

GloVe Embeddings:
GloVe embeddings are pre-trained word vectors that capture the semantic meaning of words based on their distribution in a large corpus of text. These word embeddings have proven to be effective in various natural language processing tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation. By leveraging GloVe embeddings, our fake news detector can understand the context and relationships between words, improving its accuracy in distinguishing between genuine and fabricated news articles.
